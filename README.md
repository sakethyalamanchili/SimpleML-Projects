# Handwritten Digit Classification using Deep Learning (Neural Network)

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a deep learning model using a neural network to classify handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 to 9).

## Project Structure

1. **Import necessary libraries**: Import libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn for building and visualizing the model.

2. **Loads the MNIST dataset**: Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's built-in dataset API. This dataset will be used for training and evaluating the model.

3. **Image Labels**: Explore the dataset and visualize some sample images along with their corresponding labels to understand the data.

4. **Preparing the model**: Build and compile a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of input, hidden, and output layers with appropriate activation functions.

5. **Accuracy on Test Data**: Train the model on the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the test data to assess its performance.

6. **Predict - Custom Data**: Test the trained model by predicting the labels of custom handwritten digit images.

## How to Run
